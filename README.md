# time-series-analysis

### Overview

Most events may be viewed, or converted to time-series. The purpose of this project is to provide tools to analyze time-series for the purpose of estimating "Roughness", "Fractal Dimension" and help create some intuition of the predictability and exposure to extremities.  

### Generators

* `generator_randomwalk.ipynb` : Notebook for generating a random walk dataset. Data is written into the `datasets` folder, as CSV file. Filename include `rw` prefix and timestamp. The notebook includes basic visualization and analysis of the generated walk.

* `generator_whitenoise.ipynb` : Notebook for generating a "white noise" dataset. Data is written into the `datasets` folder, as CSV file. Filename include `wn` prefix and timestamp. The notebook includes basic visualization and analysis of the generated series.

* `generator_basic_fractal.ipynb`: Notebook for generating a basic "fractal" dataset. The Fractal is generated around a random trend-line to simulate financial data. Data is written into the `datasets` folder, as CSV file. Filename include `bf` prefix and timestamp. The notebook includes basic visualization and analysis of the generated series.
